This is a mini project created to understand the working of context api in react

Context Api
- In React, the Context API is a feature that allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. 
- It's especially useful for sharing data that needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.



We need to create a context and then consume it wherever we want by simply wrapping the all the components in the ContextProvider.
